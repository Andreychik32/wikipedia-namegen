# Wikipedia name generator

### General purpose

This app is designed for those people, who can't come up with naming something.
The core feature is that all words are chosen randomly from a random article in Wikipedia.


## How to run

It's as simple as running these commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Andreychik32/wikipedia-namegen.git
$ cd wikipedia-namegen/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
Maybe someday I will port this one to the web. Stay tuned.

**Happy naming!**
